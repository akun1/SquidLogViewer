# SquidLogViewer

This simple page was made to make looking at Squid Logs easier. The format of the table follows the default format of Squid logs.

If you want to do this yourself, just edit the variables in index.js file such as the IP white list and the relative path to the log file.

Additionally, make sure you configure your squid.conf file to deliver access logs to the squid_access.log file.
